# Lapis-DPD-VGA-Bracket

Allows certain LAPIS video cards for early Macintosh computers to output VGA signals.

## Purpose

This repository contains the schematics and production data for a small PCB/bracket that adapts some LAPIS video cards used in early Macintosh systems so they can drive a standard VGA monitor. It has been developed with the SE/30 Dual Page Display Card in mind and has only been tested with this card.

## Assembly

To assemble the boards, you will need a VGA connector, 6x150Ω 1206 resistors and a 8x2 pin header. The 4-pin header exposes the monitor's ROM and is not needed.
